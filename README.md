# Achieving-Better-Dental-Outcomes-with-CBCT-at-Butler.-08-9544-3999
The advantages of using Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) in dentistry are numerous and have revolutionized the way dentists diagnose and treat various dental conditions.
As part of our commitment to providing advanced imaging solutions, Butler Medical Imaging has installed a state-of-the-art CBCT imaging system. This allows patients to access high-quality dental imaging services without the inconvenience of traveling elsewhere for additional X-rays. With Dental CBCT in Butler, we are enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving dental treatment outcomes.

High-Quality 3D Images
CBCT provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images of oral structures, offering a comprehensive view that is not possible with conventional 2D dental X-rays. This detailed imaging allows us to see teeth, bones, nerves, and soft tissues in exceptional clarity, leading to more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning.
Precise Treatment Planning
CBCT scans enable precise and personalized treatment planning for various dental procedures, including dental implants, orthodontics, and root canal treatments. With these images, dentists can assess the anatomy of the jawbone, identify optimal implant placement sites, and create tailored treatment plans, leading to more successful outcomes and reduced treatment times.
Minimal Radiation Exposure
While CBCT scans involve some radiation, advancements in technology have significantly reduced exposure levels compared to traditional medical CT scans. Additionally, CBCT scans are usually localized to the specific area of interest, minimizing exposure to the rest of the body.
Improved Dental Implants
CBCT plays a crucial role in implant dentistry by allowing dentists to assess bone volume, density, and quality at potential implant sites. This information helps determine the most appropriate implant size, type, and angulation, resulting in successful and long-lasting implant placements.
Enhanced Endodontic Procedures
In endodontics (root canal treatments), CBCT provides detailed images of the tooth's root canal system, including complex anatomical variations in each canal. This aids in accurately diagnosing and treating root canal issues and improves the overall success rate of the procedure.
Early Detection of Pathologies
CBCT is invaluable in detecting dental pathologies, such as tumors, cysts, and hidden infections, at an early stage. Early detection allows for timely intervention and better treatment outcomes.
Advantages of Dental CBCT Scans 
The benefits of Dental CBCT Scans at Crystal Radiology extend to both patients and practitioners, ensuring better outcomes and a smoother diagnostic process. 
1. High Precision and Detail 
CBCT scans capture intricate details of dental and maxillofacial structures, enabling accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. 
2. Comprehensive Imaging 
Unlike traditional X-rays, CBCT scans provide a 360-degree view of the oral cavity and surrounding areas, offering insights into hard-to-see areas. 
3. Non-Invasive and Quick 
The scan process is quick, painless, and non-invasive, typically taking only a few minutes to complete. 
4. Lower Radiation Exposure 
CBCT technology uses lower radiation doses compared to traditional CT scans, making it a safer choice for dental imaging. 
5. Improved Treatment Outcomes 
With detailed imaging, dental professionals can plan treatments with higher accuracy, reducing risks and ensuring better patient satisfaction.
